# Zork1Cv2
Zork 1 native port (Arduino, DOS, Windows, Linux...)

This project grew out of my attempt to write a new parser for a 1980s text adventure game called Crystal Caverns. After finishing that project, I reused the code to port Zork I, the game that inspired it, to C.

It is nearly complete, and is playable from beginning to end.
